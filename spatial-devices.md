### Linear Perspective

One point, or linear perspective is based around receding parallel lines that appear to meet at a vanishing point on the horizon, or at eye level. 

### Overlapping

Overlapping refers to the layering of different elements in a single image, one thing on top of another.

For example, Photoshop is a great example of software that utilises overlapping of layers to create a new image. A more conventional, traditional usage of overlapping could be seen in the way some artists put several layers of paint on top of each other as a way of making the colour stronger, or creating a richer textural surface.

The way Vincent Van Gogh layered his work thickly with paint to create a rich texture is a good example of this.

### Chiaroscuro

This is a Italian word for the relationship between something light and dark. It is often used when referring to paintings that have strong shading (strong contrast of black and white, light and shadow).
