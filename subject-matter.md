## What does it mean? How and when can I use it?

### In a nutshell...

...subject matter could be described as what the work is about. According to the Oxford Dictionary of English, subject matter is defined as 

> the topic dealt with or the subject represented in a debate, exposition, or work of art.

In the case of art history, we are dealing with works of art when talking about subject matter. It means what is the story behind the work that you are looking at, what is it depicting or dealing with?

*Note: "Subject matter", "meaning" and "context" are often linked, so it is useful to know what both of these terms mean before we set out trying to use either one of them!*

### An example

Let's look at an example of an artist from Aotearoa NZ[^1] and try and find out what the subject matter is in their work.

At a basic level, you could say that the work is about flowers (because that is what you see in the image!). However, let's compare what we might think just at an initial glance vs. what the work is actually about.

**First impressions** - *This is a pretty flower arrangement that has been photographed. The subject matter is flowers and that is what is being represented in the picture.*

**Deeper analysis** - *The bouquets possess a stillness that rivets you long before you realize that each is an immaculate fake, hand-made from silk and plastic. And they have a grandeur that would feel sober even if you didn't know that the titles - Amiens, Passchendaele - are the names of foreign fields where the Maori Pioneer Battalion fought 'for King and Country' in World War I, or that "Piko nei te Matenga" is a traditional lament for a fallen chief; it translates as "When our heads are bowed with woe".
So their extravagance honours an extravagant loss. The cumulative effect is architectural, as of a series of massive niches in some light-soaked church. The bouquets are preserved - almost embalmed - in a strange, shadowless, creamy glow. They seem hyper-real yet untouchable, totally present yet out of time. And this tension - between the hallucinatory fullness of the blooms and the bell jar silence that contains them - is the source of their pathos.
To arrange scentless, unwilting silk flowers is to commemorate stilled lives (silk is what military colours are made of). To seal those bouquets in a photograph is to make something twice stilled, twice removed. It is not just death but homelessness - the distance between body and land, an especially sacred relation for Maori - that these images mark and mourn so beautifully. The photographs are, you realize, virtual tombs, interring not bodies but absences. The exhibition is their mobile cenotaph.[^2]*
