## What are symbols and what is symbolism? How do I spot what a symbol is and what it means?

### In a nutshell...

...a symbol is a mark or character that represents something. For example, we know that an arrow is a symbol that navigates us (to either go left, right, straight, etc). Symbols are like codes for representing something larger, like a sign or even a meme!

We talked about context in the previous section. Something like a meme makes us laugh because of its context, something that we understand or relate to. The meme acts as a symbol that points to the context, something that all symbols do.
