## What is context, and what does it mean when looking at artworks?

### In a nutshell...

...the word context often is used to reference the things around something. According to the Oxford Dictionary, context means:

>the circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement, or idea, and in terms of which it can be fully understood.

In the case of art history, we often need to take the history behind an artwork to get a greater sense of what it represents, otherwise we would be missing the history side of this subject!

And why do we need to understand the history / context surrounding a work? It has the power to dramatically change the way we read a work - it might give it new meaning!

### An example 

![Robyn Kahukiwa's "War", 2012](https://assets.aucklandartgallery.com/assets/media/2014-five-maori-painters-main.jpg)

Let's have a look at this painting by Robyn Kahukiwa.[^1] It depicts a scene...using mostly red, black and white colours. These colours are significant to the painting in that they are the Maori colours found in the flag.

Now, Kahukiwa has given us clues as to the context behind this work. Can you spot a few yourself?

Firstly, there is art historical context behind "War." It is based off of the famous war painting by Pablo Picasso called *Guernica* (1937).[^2]

Talk about the link that Kahukiwa is trying to make, tying what Picasso felt about the horrors in Spain (the fascists) with that of the Maori in Aotearoa (the Treaty as a false hope, and the Crown being the murderer here). 

It is worth noting just how significant the context of images can be even in the present day. When making a statement about the war in Iraq, U.N. officials covered up a replica of Guernica that normally acted as the backdrop of their press conferences.[^3] A painting that is a protest of the horrors of war, covered up and hidden during a U.N. speech that was everything to do with it, is a poignant gesture.

So, to fully appreciate a painting like War or even Guernica, one needs to have some understanding of the context behind the works, namely the politics associated with it.

### And in Kahukiwa's own words...

From this video of Kahukiwa talking we learn the following contextual information about War:

- that the painting is based off of comments made by Hone Harawira talking about how the Maori are still engaged "in a war for the future of our children," and this is what motivated her to do her painting (see the note that she's included in the bottom centre of the image)
- that painting about tikanga Maori has allowed her to reconnect with her whakapapa/geneology 
- she had never done a painting about war before until this one. Guernica was the first war painting that came to mind

These are all points that add to our understanding of the painting. They are things that we cannot figure out just by looking at the picture, and need to research the historical context behind in order to get a greater sense of what something like "War" represents. When we get to know as much as we possibly can about a work, we can feel confident writing about it without missing out any critical information!
